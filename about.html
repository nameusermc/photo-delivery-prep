            <h2>What is Photo Delivery Prep?</h2>
            <p>Photo Delivery Prep is a browser-based utility for photographers and videographers. It solves a common workflow pain point: after exporting your final selects, client needs change — images get reordered, selects shift, or you need to strip metadata before sending. Rather than re-exporting from Lightroom, Capture One, or your NLE, this tool lets you rename, renumber, clean EXIF data, and package everything into a ZIP — right in your browser.</p>

            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>All file processing happens locally on your device using JavaScript. Your photos and videos are never uploaded to a server. The tool reads your files in the browser, applies the renaming and metadata changes you specify, and generates a ZIP file for download. No accounts, no cloud storage, no tracking.</p>

            <h2>Who built this?</h2>
            <p>Photo Delivery Prep was built by a photographer who got tired of re-exporting files every time a client changed their mind about delivery order. It started as a personal tool and grew into something worth sharing.</p>

            <h2>Privacy &amp; Security</h2>
            <p>Your files never leave your device. There is no server-side file processing, no upload, no storage, and no analytics tracking your file contents. The only network requests the site makes are to load the page itself and to process payments through Paddle (our payment provider) if you choose to unlock unlimited processing. You can read the full <a href="privacy.html">privacy policy</a> for details.</p>
