Incident Report
Project: PhotoDeliveryPrep
Domain: photodeliveryprep.com
Hosting: Vercel
Date Opened: 2026-01-22
Date Resolved: 2026-01-24

Status: Closed — Root Cause Identified
Severity: Medium (ISP-specific access failure)

1. Incident Summary
Users on certain home internet providers (notably Comcast and Spectrum) were unable to load photodeliveryprep.com. Errors included SSL protocol failures and “potentially harmful site” warnings. The site loaded successfully on cellular data, other ISPs, and via Vercel preview URLs.
After extensive testing, the issue was confirmed not to be caused by hosting, DNS, SSL configuration, devices, browsers, or local networking equipment. The root cause was identified as ISP-level reputation blocking due to recent domain registration.

2. Impact
Site inaccessible on:
Comcast (Xfinity) home networks
Spectrum home networks
Site accessible on:
Cellular data
Cox ISP
Vercel preview URLs
No data loss
No security compromise
No misconfiguration detected

3. Symptoms Observed
ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR on some devices
“Potentially harmful site” warnings on Comcast
Inconsistent behavior depending on ISP
Same behavior across:
Mac and PC
Mobile and desktop
Multiple browsers

4. Troubleshooting & Tests Performed
Network & Device Testing
Tested on multiple devices (Mac, PC, phone)
Tested on multiple networks (home Wi-Fi, cellular, other ISPs)
Restarted modem and router multiple times
Confirmed no VPN in use
DNS & Browser Testing
Changed DNS to Google (8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4)
Flushed DNS cache
Tested across multiple browsers
Enabled DNS over HTTPS (DoH) in Firefox
Hosting & Security Verification
Verified Vercel deployment health
Confirmed SSL certificates valid and correctly provisioned
Checked VirusTotal (0/92 vendors flagged)
Checked Google Safe Browsing (no listing)
Checked alphaMountain.ai (flagged “Suspicious” due solely to domain age)

5. Root Cause Analysis
Root Cause:
The domain photodeliveryprep.com was registered approximately 2 days prior to launch.
Many ISPs (including Comcast and Spectrum) apply temporary reputation-based blocking or warnings to newly registered domains as an anti-phishing and anti-malware measure.
This block is:
Automatic
ISP-controlled
Based primarily on domain age
Independent of hosting provider or site content

6. Supporting Evidence
VirusTotal: Clean (0/92 detections)
alphaMountain.ai: Suspicious due to age only
Google Safe Browsing: No data / not flagged
Site loads immediately when DNS-over-HTTPS is enabled
Site loads on unaffected ISPs and cellular networks
Vercel preview URLs load universally

7. Resolution
No technical changes required.
Resolution:
Allow the domain to age 7–14 days to clear ISP reputation filters automatically.

8. Temporary Workarounds
Use Vercel preview URLs for affected users
Access site via cellular data
Enable DNS-over-HTTPS in supported browsers (advanced users)

9. Preventative Actions Taken
Registered future project domain (steampagecheck.com) early to allow domain aging before launch
Documented ISP domain-age behavior for future launches

10. Lessons Learned
Domain age can impact accessibility independently of DNS/SSL correctness
Comcast and Spectrum apply aggressive early-domain reputation filtering
Register domains at least 2 weeks before launch when possible
